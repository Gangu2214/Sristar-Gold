# Sristar - Node.js Wrapped Static Site

This project was generated by ChatGPT. It wraps your existing static HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap site
(original files were inside `sristar.zip`) into a small **Express.js** app that serves the files
from the `public/` folder.

## Contents
- `public/` - your original static site files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.)
- `server.js` - simple Express server that serves static assets
- `package.json` - dependencies & start scripts

## How to run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

For development with auto-restart on changes (if you have nodemon):
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Notes & Suggestions
- If your site uses relative paths, they should work as-is when served from `/`.
- If you used any server-side features (PHP, etc.), those won't run here â€” this wrapper serves static assets only.
- If you want API endpoints, database integration, or file uploads added, tell me what routes/data you need and I can integrate them.
